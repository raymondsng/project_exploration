## Tinkering with story-based pokemon game

Creating of rudimentary text-based games with simple levelling mechanics and stat points for a limited set of pokemon (To emulate a database setting) using dictionaries. Explored encryption techniques as well through the use of map and lambda functions to create a sort of password-gated entry to further access for the main part of the game. Passwords inspired by activities of my friends' on the day of creation xP

Use of text within original pokemon games, all credits to the original creators' for the names and text that may have been from the original games.
