## Snake game

Classic snake game with scoreboard implemented. Upon death, if one presses "c" upon the retry prompt, they will unlock a easter egg mode of caterpillar game. The snake will move in the fashion of a caterpillar where overall speed and responsiveness is slower. At the same time, additional body segments will be shown to attach itself to the caterpillar from the centre of the screen. Background is also converted from white to black to highlight contrast in game mode.
